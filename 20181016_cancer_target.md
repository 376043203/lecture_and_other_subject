# Novel targeted therapeutics for use in cancer  
## Dr. Vijay K.   
Dr. Vijay Pandey is Senior Research Scientist at the Tsinghua-Berkeley Shenzhen Institute (TBSI), China.  Prior to current position, Dr Vijay was a Research Fellow at the Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore. He obtained a doctoral degree (PhD) in Molecular Medicine from the University of Auckland, New Zealand. His primary research interest is directed toward understanding the basis of molecular signatures and their significance in the development of human malignancies. He has led multiple projects that have successfully designed, synthesized, and identified lead candidates for anticancer therapy. Dr Vijay has published multiple peer-reviewed research articles as first author in leading international journals in the field such as Breast Cancer Research, Endocrinology, Medicine, Cell Death & Disease (Nature) and PNAS (USA).  
Dr Vijayâ€™s research focuses on the discovery of novel secreted or membrane-bound (transmembrane) therapeutic targets for the treatment of human malignancies. At beginning, Dr Vijay introduced targeted therapy, which block the growth and spread of cancer cells by targeting specific molecules required for tumour development and progression. Then he introduced what is BCL-2. BCL-2 associated death promoter (BAD) is a common and core downstream molecule for both the RAS/MAP Kinase and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways and which regulates cancer cell survival. He wanted to find a molecule that inhibits the phosphorylated state and allows BAD to be fully effective. In his research, he found that BCL-2 and BAD, both can regulate the survival of cancer cells. In the unphosphorylated cases, BAD and BCL-2 can regulate the survival and death of cancer cells. So if he can find a novel small molecule which inhibits BAD phosphorylation, this molecule may therefore be therapeutically useful, either alone or in combination to delay or obviate development of resistance to other therapeutic agents.
