# Machine Learning Research: Current Trends and Directions 
## Dr. ZHANG Tong
 
Tong Zhang is the executive director of Tencent AI Lab, which develops advanced AI technologies in computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing, and machine learning, and builds AI applications for different Tencent products. He obtained a BA in Mathematics and Computer Science from Cornell University, and a PhD in Computer Science from Stanford University. Before joining Tencent, Tong Zhang was a professor at Rutgers University, and worked previously at IBM, Yahoo, and Baidu.  

Machine learning is at the heart of modern artificial intelligent research. Its progress has led to the fast development of AI in the past decade. In this talk, he describes the current trends and directions of machine learning research, and its practical implications.   

Firstly, Dr.Zhang introduce some products and industries of AI, for example. AI retail, medical and transportation. He said the in the future, AI would be a very important part of our life. People are going to pay attention to cloud AI to center data and Tencent also open APIs for the public. People are going to use more smart hardware and Internet things, which leads to more new human computer interaction. Also, in the physical world, people will use sensing and new scene understanding to plan and control. In Tencent, they focus more on AI+X traditional industry, including big data analysis, digital transformation and AI solution.     

Secondly, he mentions what Tencent AIâ€™s work. Their fundamental research are CV, ASR, NLP and so on, and they also have publications in top AI conferences. In machine learning research part, they start from ML basic system and theory to establish general ability to understand, making decision or optimization, and then these knowledge can be used to high-level applications.  

Finally, Dr. Zhang says some examples about their work. He talks about several algorithms to boost the accuracy and calculation efficiency. Both in fields of software and electronic devices, these thoughts can be used.
