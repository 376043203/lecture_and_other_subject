# Biophotonics for image guided surgery  
## Dr. Ji Qi   
Dr. Ji Qi is Senior Research Associate at Wellcome / EPSRC Centre for Interventional and Surgical Sciences and Department of Computer Science, University College London, UK. He holds Bachelorâ€™s degree in Optoelectronics from Nankai University, China and PhD in Biophotonics from Imperial College London, UK in 2010 and 2014 respectively. He has then worked for Elekta as R&D Scientist developing image guided adaptive radiotherapy. In 2018, he moved to University College London to continue his research on the biophotonics imaging techniques for minimally invasive surgery and robotic surgery, including polarization resolved endoscopy, depth resolved endoscopy and near infrared fluorescence endoscopy etc. Ji Qi has published over 20 peer-reviewed articles and conference proceedings, served as a peer reviewer for seven journals, and received Medical Image Analysis/ MICCAI Best Paper Award, Santander Award, Silver Award in Entrepreneurship Competition organized by China Overseas Study Association, Imperial Trust Award, etc.  

At beginning, Qi introduced what is surgical endoscopy and then he proposed the problem: the traditional endoscopy is limited to light intensity and color and also lack of depth and tissue profile information. These lack of information will lead to missing some lesions and risk of recurrence.  
In his research, he wanted to provide Optical endoscope that provides tissue contour and depth information. Also, combined with deep learning methods, this new kind biophotonics imaging can provide more explicit pictures and better disease diagnosis.  
The way he used is as below. There is a thing called optical polarization, which can get the components of tissue microstructure and birefringence. In this way, it will be very fast to identify the non-destructive organization so that diagnosis will be more explicit and quicker. Combined with deep learning, information about lighting construction can be learned to judge the contour and depth of the tissue.
