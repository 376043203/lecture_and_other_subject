Steven Chu, was born on February 28, 1948, in Louis, Missouri in the United States, the United States 12th energy secretary 1997 Nobel physics prize winner the current professor of physics at Stanford in 1970, graduated from the university of Rochester, and obtained a bachelor's degree in mathematics and physics, and in 1976 received a doctor's degree in physics at the university of California, Berkeley in 1978, served as director of the American physical society In 1993, he was awarded the king Feissel international prize for science; In 1994, he won the Arthur Schloss award and the William meigs award. In 1997, he won the Nobel Prize in physics. On June 5, 1998, he was elected as a foreign academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. From 2004 to 2008, he was the director of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in the United States and a professor of physics at the University of California at Berkeley.   

In this report, Professor Steven Chu shared the latest research progress of his research team in ultrasound super-resolution imaging and in vivo intracellular molecular imaging based on rare earth nanospheres. The biologically harmless detection methods produced by these two studies can obtain ultrasound images of living biological tissues with unprecedented high resolution, and can monitor molecular migration in living cells or tissues, which will have a major foundation in the field of biology and biomedicine. contribution.  


- 	vivo intracellular molecular imaging based on rare earth nanoparticles  
using rare earth nanoparticles as probes to conduct real-time and long-term tracking of Dynein in living cells with a time resolution of milliseconds. The rare earth nanoparticles can be used to monitor the molecular migration in living cells or tissues without photo bleaching, which means excellent light stability.  

- 	Ultrasonography  
In modern medicine, ultrasonic imaging is widely used. By combining Angle and frequency, speckle noise can be reduced by 6 to 8 times, so that the resolution can be close to the theoretical diffraction limit. the unprecedented high-resolution ultrasound image of living biological tissue can be obtained in this way.
