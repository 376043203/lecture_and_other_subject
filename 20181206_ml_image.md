Image forensics and anti-forensics have been extensively studied in the multimedia security community for over a decade. There are many interesting results showing that a variety of features inherent to images can be effectively destroyed with negligible incurred distortions. Recently, in machine learning (ML) community, the adversarial ML demonstrates that many state-of-the-art, sophistically designed ML algorithms can be very vulnerable and be easily fooled by the adversarial inputs. In this talk, we use the widely-adopted SIFT feature as an example to link the image forensics/anti-forensics and adversarial ML. It will be shown that some results and insights developed from multimedia security community can still be quite valuable in the adversarial ML community.  

Firstly, Dr Zhou introduces the definition of image forensics and image anti-forensics. Image forensics can reconstruct the history of a digital image in order to verify its truthfulness and assess its equality. Similarly, image anti-forensics is the reverse process of forensics, in order to let forensics detection fail. In his lecture, he mainly use copy-move forgery detection to extract features and detect whether these features are the same. In the method called SIFT, a keypoint or a descriptor will be generated which will be the local extrema point in 3*3*3 field.   

His work is to minimize the differences between the original image and copy-removed image using least extrema without increasing new candidate keypoint. Here he mentions an order preserving assumption: he proves that the maximization in the original images is the maximization of the copy-removed image and the minimization point of the original image is the same with the copy-removed image. In this way, the point can be easily located.   

In conclusion, he shows that features of the original picture are also valuable for the copy-removed one and using machine learning method, we can keep the most important features of the picture and also make it easier to classification.
