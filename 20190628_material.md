# Materials, manufacturing and device innovation of soft rubbery and curvy electronics: towards a seamlessly integration with human
## Cunjian Yu

Firstly, he introduces the background of the different materials and gives some interesting examples to illustrate their features and properties. He says there are some problems: for example, how to act these devices and make them more suitable for the human. For human, our biological system is more curve than electronics, and all of them are in dynamic system. However, human can only resist light pressure while the electronic can resist more than 100 Gpa and much stronger. So he wants to make a softer and curvy electronics.   
Then he introduces the notion of bending stiffness, which represents how easy a kind of materials can be bend. Based on the soft standard, different structures and materials can be applied to the electronics and make them soft. Then he proposes his idea to apply rubbery stamp, which is very thin. This material can be used in flexible camera, and some biological devices. But in order to make it better, there is still some challenges to deal with instead of only making flexible materials. Then next step is to make them stretchy.   
He introduces a kind of stretchy, unnoticeable electronics which can memory the information of human or robot, and also control the movement of the robot. Whatâ€™s more, this material can develop the interfaces between human and robots. Moreover, stretchy materials can be used in many medical areas.   
But for different materials, there are still some differences for their stress resistance. So he says, the properties of different materials can be used in different areas. For structural engineering, the softness of iron or mental can be put in the engineering construction.   
Finally, he concludes his research. There are 0-2 D Nano fillers and organic conductors. For dielectrics, there are elastomers and ionic feils. But there is no semiconductors. So this is the future direction for his research.
