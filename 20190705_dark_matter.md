# Dark matter
## Haibo Yu
Haibo Yu is from university of California, Riverside. Yu firstly introduces what dark matter is. The first evidences for dark matter is from coma cluster. Fritz Zwicky found this cluster means very fast, which means there must have enough weight to hold this gravity, while the stars we can see cannot match the weight it supposed to have. After 1800s, the development of the technology makes the detection of spiral galaxy possible, but the cluster speed is also not match the gravity. Whatâ€™s more, the cosmic microwave background shows the disparity of the university, laying a foundation of the founding of the dark matter.  
Actually, the milky way we live in is surrounded within dark matter halo. Dark matter can move very fast with low density. But how our university structure forms? It comes from the gathering of dark matter. As for the different minerals in the university, their origins are different. In the raw university, there is only He and H. only when a super star explode, are there is other minerals, like Mg, Na, Fe. With the help of dark matter, these minerals, coming from the explosion, can be retained in our university.   
From the small perspective, there are some fundamental interactions between tiny particles: gravity, electromagnetism, weak and strong interactions. For each power, there is a particle to express this power from one to the other one. Dark matter is dark, stable and cold. But there is no particles we know can satisfy the standard of dark matter. So there is a conflict between university and basic particles.  
There are several ways to detect dark matter. You can detect them from the interaction between different particles or direct detect them with the standard.   
Finally, he introduces several lab working on the dark matters. There are so many labs separated in our world and in China ,there is a lab called panda can detect dark matter directly.
