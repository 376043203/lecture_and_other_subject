# Boosting Optical Network Operation with Machine Learning  
## Dr. Jelena PESIC   
Jelena Pesic received a Ph.D. from the University of Bretagne Sud in collaboration with France Telecom–Orange Labs, France, in 2012. From 2012 to 2014, she was a postdoctoral fellow at INRIA and Telecom Bretagne working on the European project SASER. She received a best paper award at the IEEE ONDM conference in 2011. After joining Alcatel–Lucent (now Nokia) Bell Labs in 2014, she focused on dynamic elastic networks dimensioning and techno-economic studies. Her main areas of research interest include intelligent optical networks, including core and metro networks. Dr. Pesic was selected as OSA Ambassador for 2018 and she was a TCP member for IEEE ONDM, APC and ACP.  
She will give an overview of the current mode of operation of optical networks and we present the potential improvement brought by implementation of Machine Learning algorithms in a future mode of network operation. At beginning, Dr. Pesic introduced her life working in PESIC, which is a very good family for research and live. Then she mentioned what is optical networks. Her research goal is to reduce the network design margin with lower cost. Her method is to improve QoT（quality of transmission）and estimate SNR（signal-to-noise）.  
In the next part, she talked about the process of her experiments and the gathering of data. Firstly, she studied the main network of Europe, there are 28 nodes and 41 ways. Secondly, she established a model based on the estimation paramount. These data are available through amplifier output power and associated receiver SNR. Thirdly, she used machine learning method to reduce the uncertainty of the paramount input. Finally, she showed some related data and her result from experiment, that is, no matter how big the uncertainty is, QoT can effectively reduce dBs, which means less mistake and lower cost.
