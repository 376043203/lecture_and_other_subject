# Smart city, smart energy and smart decision making   
## Dr. Xiaonan Wang  
Prof Xiaonan Wang is an assistant professor and a promising female scientist in the department of chemical and bimolecular engineering, nation university of Singapore. Her study topic is smart systems engineering with a group more than 15 team members at NUS.   

She firstly introduces her smart systems engineering (SSE) research, including smart city, smart energy and healthcare. Different from traditional process, smart systems engineering needs to cover more topics and there are more levels to study, what’s more the change of different time periods of city should also be concluded in the research. Because of the human demand, climate change and energy usage in big cities, she talks about her motivations of her research, that is, using sustainable systems to produce and clean energy.   
Her systems cover different type of systems, multi-scale systems. In the different systems, there are different energy flows and materials. Moreover, in these systems, she combines the theories and human behaviors together to make more rational decision making. From collection data from national report or observation, with the help of agent model, the simulation, she can consider the potential performance of the climate or other behaviors. This model can also be used to assess the behaviors of some protect methods, like water cleaning systems.   
Then she details the agent-based modeling used in the model. Using agent-based modeling, it is easy to get the demand, which is an important part to the model. Also, there are some other demand-side simulation for the model. We have to consider the sparse different distribution of Chinese population and different geography features in different areas. For supply-side, she focuses more on the new technologies to replace the traditional one. Using high temperature or organic methods, it is easier and more environment-friendly. What’s more, in order to test the availability of the supply optimization in the real situations.   
Finally, she shows some case studies to illustrate the demand and supply optimization.
